# Legacy Files

This directory contains configuration files from my old Mac, preserved for historical reference.

## Contents

- `Brewfile` - Homebrew packages from previous setup
- `.vimrc` - Old vim configuration
- `.zshrc` - Old zsh configuration with oh-my-zsh setup

These files are **not actively used** and are kept only for reference when setting up new machines or remembering what tools were previously installed.
